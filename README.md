# Pizza-Ordering
This program takes an order and stores the strings in list. The order can be done
In random order, doing drinks, then wings, then drinks, then pizza, etc.
Regardless, the orders get stored in respective lists of list. Double for
loops are used to sort through the different elements in the lists in the cost
functions. Print statements are generated in the form of formated strings
and a list of costs is returned. Those lists are then sorted through and the 
total cost is calculated. The outputing is done in a nice symmetrical grid
regardless of input. I made it accomidate up to 5 toppings on a pizza. Any more
room and it would've become too wide to look presentable. 

The variable names and process can be altered for actuall application is the values
and prices are known. Sinple back end stuff that can be expanded upon certainly.
